    <!--  Tracker Profiling Info -->
    <string name="trackerProfilingActivityTitle">About Trackers</string>
    <string name="trackerProfilingInfoTitle">How do trackers profile you?</string>
    <string name="trackerProfilingInfoFirstParagraph">Let’s take the prime example — Google. If you ask most people what Google’s business is they will say “search,” but Google actually makes a lot of its money from serving ads on other sites.\n\nPut simply, Google isn’t a search company, they’re an advertising company.\n\nPrinceton’s WebTAP privacy project recently found that Google’s trackers are installed on 75% of the top million Internet websites. (The next closest is Facebook at 25%!)</string>
    <string name="trackerProfilingInfoSecondParagraph">Google sells ads not only on their search engine, but also on over 2.2 million other websites and over 1 million apps. Every time you visit one of these sites or apps, Google is storing that information and using it to target ads at you.\n\nThat’s why you may have seen ads tracking you across the net!\n\nDuckDuckGo Privacy Browser blocks many trackers from Google and other companies as you browse. With Device Shield, we can block trackers in other apps, too. This reduces what companies know about you overall, so you can enjoy peace of mind!</string>

    <!--  Device Shield FAQ -->

    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFirstHeader">What trackers does Device Shield block?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFirstText">Device Shield <b>blocks known trackers</b> that it identifies <b>from third-party companies, or those different from the company that owns each app.</b> For example, if Facebook owns the app, Device Shield doesn’t block its trackers, but would block trackers from Google or Amazon. We’re always on the lookout for other trackers for Device Shield to block.\n\nSome apps and known trackers might be excluded automatically based on whether they’d work properly with Device Shield enabled. </string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQSecondHeader">Why does Device Shield use a VPN connection?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQSecondText">You’ll be asked to set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection, <b>but you don\'t need to install a VPN app for Device Shield to work.</b>\n\nThis permission, which works only on your device, allows Device Shield to monitor network traffic <b>so that it can block known trackers.</b></string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQThirdHeader">How is Device Shield different from a VPN?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQThirdText">A traditional VPN sends your data from the device to its own server, where it secures and anonymizes your data from prying eyes. <b>However, this allows the VPN company to see your network traffic.</b>\n\n<b>Device Shield is different.</b> Instead of sending your data to a VPN server, <b>Device Shield works only on your device</b>, sitting between your apps and the servers they talk to.\n\nWhenever Device Shield recognizes a known tracker, <b>it blocks the tracker from sending personal information (such as your IP address, activity, and device details) off your device.</b> All other traffic reaches its destination, so your apps work normally.</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFourthHeader">Is my data private?</string>
    <string name="deviceShieldFAQFourthText">Device Shield works only on your device and doesn’t send your data off your device to DuckDuckGo. <b>We don’t collect or store any data from your apps.</b></string>
