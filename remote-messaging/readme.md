# Remote Messaging
The Remote Messaging Framework is a tool designed to display messages to users without the need for an app release.

The framework relies on a Remote Config, [hosted on a different repository](https://github.com/duckduckgo/remote-messaging-config), to create and deliver messages.

We have [different types](https://app.asana.com/0/0/1201781670211066/f) of remote messages with [optional illustrations](https://app.asana.com/0/0/1201781670211076/f) and customizable [button actions](https://app.asana.com/0/0/1201781670211060/f). We can target users based on [matching attributes](https://app.asana.com/0/0/1201781670211033/f) that are evaluated locally on the user's device.

Messages are expected to be ephemeral and occasional, some examples are:
- Promote features
- Privacy tips or promoting articles
- Small messages in front of users
- Promoting an specific search
- Promoting a critical update
- ...
