## How to help

1. Each language has a [`values`](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/tree/develop/app/src/main/res) directory containing the language code, and the `strings.xml` file contains the translations. Examples:
    - Italian translation files are located within `app/src/main/res/values-it/strings.xml`  
    - Spanish translation files are located within `app/src/main/res/values-es/strings.xml`
1. If you notice anything which could be improved, you should create a PR containing the improved language suggestions.
    1. Make the changes to the relevant `strings.xml` file
    1. Test the app in the language you've improved, and ensure the changed strings look good
    1. Create a PR. As well as the changes themselves, explaining _why_ the changes are an improvement helps a lot.
