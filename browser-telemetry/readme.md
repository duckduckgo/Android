# Browser telemetry
This is a broad term utilized for the temporary collection of additional information (only when specifically enabled) for the purpose of performance analysis on the browser.

One example of this is the collection of the full version of the webview during app launch when the "browserTelemetry" feature and "appLaunch" sub-feature are enabled.
