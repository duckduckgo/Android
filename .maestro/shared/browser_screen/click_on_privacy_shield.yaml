# This flow opens the Privacy Dashboard from the Omnibar.
#
# Unfortunately, we can't click the privacy shield directly because the shield is a Lottie animation view which extends beyond the bounds of the text input field.
# Trying to click it directly will result in a tap on the text input field instead.
#
# I tried using the "point" and "leftOf" selector features to click the shield directly, the former is a known issue (https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/Maestro/issues/1421)
# and trying to click to the left of the input text field didn't work for me either.
#
# To work around this, when view_new_omnibar is used, we tap on the Omnibar icon container
# which aligns with the shield and has a non-zero size because of an invisible pulse animation placeholder that's within it.
# That shield animation placeholder is in a different place for the view_fade_omnibar, so we're using a conditional flow to handle both cases.
