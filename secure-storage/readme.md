# Secure Storage

Secure storage is responsible for storing and retrieving sensitive data, such as logins, on the device using encryption.

While the vast majority of devices support secure storage, there are some which don't. 
The secure storage APIs provide the capability to check if secure storage can be used on this device. 
If a feature relies on secure storage, but it's not available, it is the feature's responsibility to handle this gracefully.
