    <string name="autoconsentDescription">When DuckDuckGo detects cookie consent pop-ups on sites you visit, we can try to automatically set your cookie preferences to minimize cookies and maximize privacy, then close the pop-ups. Some sites don\'t provide an option to manage cookie preferences, so we can only hide pop-ups like these.</string>
