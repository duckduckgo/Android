/**
 * Repeated prompts to use Autofill (e.g., save login credentials) might annoy a user who doesn't want to use Autofill.
 * If the user has declined too many times without using it, we will prompt them to disable.
 *
 * This class is used to track the number of times a user has declined to use Autofill when prompted.
 * It should be permanently disabled, by calling disableDeclineCounter(), when user:
 *    - saves a credential, or
 *    - chooses to disable autofill when prompted to disable autofill, or
 *    - chooses to keep using autofill when prompted to disable autofill
