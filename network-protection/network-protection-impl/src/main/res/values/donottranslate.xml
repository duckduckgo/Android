    <!-- Info VPN -->
    <string name="netpInfoVPNTitle">What is a VPN?</string>
    <string name="netpInfoVPNFirstQuestion">What is a VPN?</string>
    <string name="netpInfoVPNFirstAnswer">A virtual private network, commonly known as a VPN, protects your privacy and anonymity online by <b>hiding your IP address so websites and apps can\'t identify you</b> or your location by accessing your real IP address. VPNs also <b>encrypt the data sent over your device\'s network connection</b> so information that could otherwise reveal your identity or your online activities (e.g., the links you click, the files you download, or the messages you send) is obscured from others on the same network.\n\nUsing a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi, in places like coffee shops or airports, prevents your private information and browsing habits from being exposed to others on the network. Using a VPN on your home network <b>hides your web browsing history from your Internet service provider</b>, who could otherwise log and sell that information to third parties.</string>
    <string name="netpInfoVPNSecondQuestion">How does a VPN work?</string>
    <string name="netpInfoVPNSecondAnswer">A VPN allows you to <b>re-route your online activity through a remote server</b> in another location operated by the VPN provider. This ensures that websites and apps see the remote server\'s IP address location instead of your real one. VPNs also encrypt (or scramble) data in-transit, so others can\'t read it.\n\nThere can be some drawbacks to using a VPN. Depending on how far away you are from the remote server, your Internet speed may be affected. Some websites and apps also intentionally limit access to people using a VPN. Additionally, some VPN providers may also log and share your online activity with 3rd parties. <b>Using a VPN with a "no logging" privacy policy</b> like DuckDuckGo\'s Network Protection <b>is recommended.</b></string>

    <!-- FAQS -->
    <string name="netpFaqTitle">Network Protection FAQs</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionOne">How does Network Protection work?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerOne">Network Protection uses the open source WireGuard protocol to configure a virtual private network (VPN) on your device. When enabled, all of your device traffic is first encrypted and then routed through the nearest VPN server to protect your browsing activity from Internet service providers and hide your location from apps and sites you visit.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionTwo">Is only my web browsing protected?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerTwo">All of the network activity on your device is protected.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionThree">Does DuckDuckGo keep logs of my data?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerThree">No, we do not store logs.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionFour">Where are DuckDuckGo VPN servers located?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerFour">DuckDuckGo offers a limited number of servers while Network Protection is in beta, located in the United States and Europe.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionFive">Why can\'t I choose my server location?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerFive">Network Protection automatically selects the nearest server to you to maintain the highest connection speed possible while browsing.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionSix">Why do some apps not work when Network Protection is on?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerSix">Some websites and apps intentionally limit access to people using a VPN. For example, they may ask you to solve a CAPTCHA to ensure you\'re a real person instead of a bot. If you experience repeated issues with an app, you can exclude it from the VPN altogether under Network Protection settings.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionSeven">Why can\'t I dismiss the Network Protection notifications?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerSeven">Android requires that VPNs show a persistent notification while the VPN is enabled.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionEight">Is Network Protection compatible with App Tracking Protection?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerEight">Yes, both Network Protection and App Tracking Protection can be on at the same time. No other VPNs are compatible with DuckDuckGo App Tracking Protection.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionNine">Is Network Protection free to use?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerNine">Network Protection is free to use while in beta. Eventually it will be offered as a paid service.</string>
