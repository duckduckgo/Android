    <!-- FAQS -->
    <string name="netpFaqTitle">Frequently Asked Questions</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionOne">How does DuckDuckGo VPN work?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerOne">The VPN uses the open source WireGuard protocol to configure a virtual private network (VPN) on your device. When enabled, all of your device traffic is first encrypted and then routed through the nearest VPN server to protect your browsing activity from Internet service providers and hide your location from apps and sites you visit.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionTwo">Is only my web browsing protected?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerTwo">All of the network activity on your device is protected.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionThree">Does DuckDuckGo keep logs of my data?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerThree">No, we do not store logs.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionFour">Where are the VPN servers located?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerFour">DuckDuckGo offers a limited number of servers while DuckDuckGo VPN is in beta, located in the United States, Canada, and Europe.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionSix">Why do some apps not work when the VPN is on?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerSix">Some websites and apps intentionally limit access to people using a VPN. For example, they may ask you to solve a CAPTCHA to ensure you\'re a real person instead of a bot. If you experience repeated issues with an app, you can exclude it from the VPN altogether under DuckDuckGo VPN settings.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionSeven">Why can\'t I dismiss VPN notifications?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerSeven">Android requires that VPNs show a persistent notification while the VPN is enabled.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionEight">Is the VPN compatible with App Tracking Protection?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerEight">Yes, both the VPN and App Tracking Protection can be on at the same time. No other VPNs are compatible with DuckDuckGo App Tracking Protection.</string>
    <string name="netpFaqQuestionNine">Is the VPN free to use?</string>
    <string name="netpFaqAnswerNine">DuckDuckGo VPN is free to use while in beta. Eventually it will be offered as a paid service.</string>

    <string name="netpTermQuestionThree">You must be eligible to use this service.</string>
    <string name="netpTermAnswerThree">• Access to this beta is randomly awarded. You are responsible for ensuring eligibility.\n• You must be at least 18 years old and live in a location where use of a VPN is legal in order to be eligible to use this service.</string>

    <string name="netpTermQuestionFour">We provide this beta service as-is and without warranty.</string>
    <string name="netpTermAnswerFour">• This service is provided as-is and without warranties or guarantees of any kind. \n• To the extent possible under applicable law, DuckDuckGo will not be liable for any damage or loss arising from your use of the service. In any event, the total aggregate liability of DuckDuckGo shall not exceed $25 or the equivalent in your local currency.\n• We may in the future transfer responsibility for the service to a subsidiary of DuckDuckGo.  If that happens, you agree that references to “DuckDuckGo” will refer to our subsidiary, which will then become responsible for providing the service and for any liabilities relating to it.</string>

    <string name="netpPrivacyQuestionTwo">We don’t keep any logs of your online activity.</string>
    <string name="netpPrivacyAnswerTwo">• That means we have no way to tie what you do online to you as an individual and we don’t have any record of things like:\n\t • Website visits\n\t • DNS requests\n\t • Connections made\n\t • IP addresses used\n\t • Session lengths</string>

    <string name="netpPrivacyQuestionThree">We only keep anonymous performance metrics that we cannot connect to your online activity.</string>
    <string name="netpPrivacyAnswerThree">• Our servers store generic usage (for example, CPU load) and diagnostic data (for example, errors), but none of that data is connected to any individual’s activity.\n• We use this non-identifying information to monitor and ensure the performance and quality of the service, for example to make sure servers aren’t overloaded.</string>

    <string name="netpPrivacyQuestionFour">We use dedicated servers for all VPN traffic.</string>
    <string name="netpPrivacyAnswerFour">• Dedicated servers means they are not shared with anyone else.\n• We rent our servers from providers we carefully selected because they meet our privacy requirements.\n• We have strict access controls in place so that only limited DuckDuckGo team members have access to our servers.</string>

    <string name="netpPrivacyQuestionFive">We protect and limit use of your data when you communicate directly with DuckDuckGo. </string>
    <string name="netpPrivacyAnswerFive">• If you reach out to us for support by submitting a bug report or through email and agree to be contacted to troubleshoot the issue, we’ll contact you using the information you provide.\n• If you participate in a voluntary product survey or questionnaire and agree to provide further feedback, we may contact you using the information you provide.\n• We will permanently delete all personal information you provided to us (email, contact information), within 30 days after closing a support case or, in the case of follow up feedback, within 60 days after ending this beta service.</string>
