     * We want to exclude local network traffic from routing through the VPN, but include everything else
     *
     * The VPN APIs don't allow you to add everything and then exclude some ranges.
     * Instead, we must be selective in what we add to ensure local addresses aren't routed.
     *
     * We exclude:
     *   - private local IP ranges
     *   - CGNAT address range 100.64.0.0 -> 100.127.255.255
     *   - special IP addresses 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
     *   - not allocated to host (Class E) IP address - 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
     *   - link-local address range
     *   - multicast (Class D) address range - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
     *   - broadcast address
