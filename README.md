# DuckDuckGo Android

Welcome to our android application. We are excited to engage the community in development, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## We are hiring!
Are you a talented cross-platform mobile developer? We are looking for a Senior Cross-Platform Engineer to help shape our mobile apps. We embrace diverse perspectives, and seek out passionate, self-motivated people, committed to our shared vision of raising the standard of trust online. Visit our [careers](https://duckduckgo.com/hiring/#open) page to find out more!

## Building the Project
We use git submodules and so when you are checking out the app, you'll need to ensure the submodules are initialized properly. You can use the `--recursive` flag when cloning the project to do this.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/duckduckgo/android.git

Alternatively, if you already have the project checked out, you can initialize the submodules manually.

    git submodule update --init
