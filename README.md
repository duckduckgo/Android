## Discuss

Contact us at https://duckduckgo.com/feedback if you have feedback, questions or want to chat.

## Building the Project
We use git submodules and so when you are checking out the app, you'll need to ensure the submodules are initialized properly. You can use the `--recursive` flag when cloning the project to do this.

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/duckduckgo/android.git

Alternatively, if you already have the project checked out, you can initialize the submodules manually.

    git submodule update --init

## Reporting Bugs

We want our app to be as stable as possible thus your bug reports are immensely valuable. When reporting bugs let us know the:
* App version
* Device make and model
* Android version
* Steps to reproduce the bug
* Expected behavior
* Actual behavior
