              Use a fully opaque (100% alpha) color for the mask.

              The actual color doesn't matter, but devices handle the alpha channel differently:
              - On tested devices, a 0% alpha mask makes the ripple effect invisible.
              - On tested Pixels, any alpha > 0% applies the ripple color correctly.
              - On tested Samsungs, the ripple alpha is affected by both the mask and the ripple color alpha,
                summing them up and causing unexpected results.

              To ensure consistent ripple visibility across devices, always use a fully opaque mask.
