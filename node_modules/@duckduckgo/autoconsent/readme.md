# Autoconsent

This is a library of rules for navigating through common consent popups on the web. These rules
can be run in a Chrome extension, or in a Playwright-orchestrated headless browser. Using
these rules, opt-in and opt-out options can be selected automatically, without requiring
user-input.

## Browser extension

The web extension can be built with the following steps:

```bash
# Download dependencies
npm ci
# Build consent ruleset
npm run build-rules
# Build JS bundles (rules must be built first)
npm run bundle
```

The extension-specific code can be found in the `addon` directory. There are two versions of the
addon (found under `dist/addon` after building), one for `mv3` version for Chromium-based browsers, and a `firefox` version for Firefox.
You can load these in [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked)
in developer mode, and in [Firefox](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/temporary-installation-in-firefox/)
as a tempoary addon.

## Rules

The library's functionality is implemented as a set of rules that define how to manage consent on
a subset of sites. These generally correspond to specific Consent Management Providers (CMPs)
that are installed on multiple sites. Each CMP ruleset defines:

 * If the site is using that CMP
 * If a popup is displayed
 * Steps to specify an 'opt-in' or 'opt-out' consent for the CMP.
 * Optionally, a test if the consent was correctly applied.

There are currently three ways of implementing a CMP:
 
 1. As a [JSON ruleset](./rules/autoconsent/), intepreted by the `AutoConsent` class. 
 1. As a class implementing the `AutoCMP` interface. This enables more complex logic than the linear AutoConsent
 rulesets allow.
 3. As a [Consent-O-Matic](https://github.com/cavi-au/Consent-O-Matic) rule. The `ConsentOMaticCMP` class implements
 compability with rules written for the Consent-O-Matic extension.

## Intermediate rules

Sometimes the opt-out process requires actions that span across multiple pages or iframes. In this case it is necessary to define stages (each corresponding to a separate page context) as separate rulesets. Each one, except the very last stage, must be marked as intermediate using the `intermediate: true` flag. If the `intermediate` flag is not set correctly, autoconsent may report a successful opt-out even if it is not yet finished.

## Context filters

By default, rules will be executed in all top-level documents. Some rules are designed for specific contexts (e.g. only nested iframes, or only specific URLs). This can be configured in `runContext` field (see the syntax reference below).

## Rule Syntax Reference

An autoconsent CMP rule can be written as either:
 * a JSON file adhering to the `AutoConsentCMPRule` type.
 * a class implementing the `AutoCMP` interface, or
   * common JSON rules are available as reusable functions in [rule-executors.ts](/lib/rule-executors.ts). You can also use existing class-based rules as reference.

In most cases the JSON syntax should be sufficient, unless some complex non-linear logic is required, in which case a class is required.

Both JSON and class implementations have the following components:
 * `name` - to identify this CMP.
 * `detectCMP` - which determines if this CMP is included on the page.
 * `detectPopup` - which determines if a popup is being shown by the CMP.
 * `optOut` - a list of actions to do an 'opt-out' from the popup screen. i.e. denying all consents possible.
 * `optIn` - a list of actions for an 'opt-in' from the popup screen.
 * (optional) `prehideSelectors` - a list of CSS selectors to "pre-hide" early before detecting a CMP. This helps against flickering. Pre-hiding is done using CSS `opacity` and `z-index`, so be it should be used with care to prevent conflicts with the opt-out process.
 * (optional) `intermediate` - a boolean flag indicating that the ruleset is part of a multi-stage process, see the [Intermediate rules](#intermediate-rules) section. This is `false` by default.
 * (optional) `runContext` - an object describing when this rule should be tried:
   * `main` - boolean, set to `true` if the rule should be executed in top-level documents (default: `true`)
   * `frame` - boolean, set to `true` if the rule should be executed in nested frames (default: `false`)
   * `url` - string, specifies a string prefix that should match the page URL (default: empty)
 * (optional) `test` - a list of actions to verify a successful opt-out. This is currently only used in Playwright tests.


`detectCMP`, `detectPopup`, `optOut`, `optIn`, and `test` are defined as a set of checks or actions on the page. In the JSON syntax this is a list of `AutoConsentRuleStep` objects. For `detect` checks, we return true for the check if all steps return true. For opt in and out, we execute actions in order, exiting if one fails. The following checks/actions are supported:

### Element exists

```json
{
  "exists": "selector"
}
```
Returns true if `document.querySelector(selector)` returns elements.

### Element visible

```json
{
  "visible": "selector",
  "check": "any" | "all" | "none"
}
```
Returns true if elements returned from `document.querySelectorAll(selector)` are currently visible on the page. If `check` is `all`, every element must be visible. If `check` is `none`, no element should be visible. Visibility check is a CSS-based heuristic.

### Wait for element

```json
{
  "waitFor": "selector",
  "timeout": 1000
}
```
Waits until `selector` exists in the page. After `timeout` ms the step fails.

### Click an element
```json
{
  "click": "selector",
  "all": true | false,
}
```
Click on an element returned by `selector`. If `all` is `true`, all matching elements are clicked. If `all` is `false`, only the first returned value is clicked.

### Wait for then click
```json
{
  "waitForThenClick": "selector",
  "timeout": 1000,
  "all": true | false
}
```
Combines `waitFor` and `click`.

### Unconditional wait
```json
{
  "wait": 1000,
}
```
Wait for the specified number of milliseconds.

### Hide
```json
{
  "hide": ["selector", ...],
  "method": "display" | "opacity"
}
```
Hide the elements matched by the selectors. `method` defines how elements are hidden: "display" sets `display: none`, "opacity" sets `opacity: 0`. Method is "display" by default.

### Eval

```json
{
  "eval": "code"
}
```
Evaluates `code` in the context of the page. The rule is considered successful if it *evaluates to a truthy value*.
Eval rules are not 100% reliable because they can be blocked by a CSP policy on the page. Therefore, they should only be used as a last resort when none of the other rules are sufficient.

### Optional actions

Any rule can include the `"optional": true` to ignore failure.
