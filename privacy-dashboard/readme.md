# Privacy Dashboard
This module hosts code related to our cross-platform privacy dashboard.
Privacy dashboard allows users to see the positive effect of our privacy protections on each site they visit.
Privacy dashboard is implemented in JS(UI) and Native(navigation, callbacks and orchestration).
JS code is updated via NPM (node_modules folder), and bundled into the app.
