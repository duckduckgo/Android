    <string name="aboutDescriptionBrandUpdate2025Rebranding">Welcome to the Duck Side!\n\nDuckDuckGo is the independent online protection company for anyone who wants to take back control of their personal information.\n\nWe believe the best way to protect your personal information from hackers, scammers, and privacy-invasive companies is to stop it from being collected at all. That\'s why millions of people <annotation type="chart_comparison">choose DuckDuckGo over Chrome and other browsers</annotation> to search and browse online. Our built-in search engine is like Google but never tracks your searches. And our browsing protections, such as ad tracker blocking and cookie blocking, help stop other companies from collecting your data. Oh, and our browser is free â€” we make money from <annotation type="privacy_respecting_ads">privacy-respecting search ads</annotation>, not by exploiting your data.\n\nIn addition, we also offer <annotation type="ppro_help_page">DuckDuckGo subscription</annotation> integrated into our browser. Subscribers get even more privacy protection with a fast and simple <annotation type="vpn_help_page">VPN</annotation> that helps secure your online activity, access to advanced AI models in our private AI chat service Duck.ai, a service that finds and removes your personal information from people-finder sites, and a service that restores your identity should it be stolen.\n\nTake back control of your personal information with the browser designed for data protection, not data collection.</string>
