We've expanded our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection to block more tracking requests. 
We also updated the Privacy Dashboard â€” you can now see additional information about which 3rd-party requests were blocked from loading, which other 3rd-party requests loaded, and the reasons for both when available.
