## What's new in this release?
- Now when you use the Fire Button, you can see your data clear away! Switch between three new animations or disable them in Settings. 🔥 🌊 🌬️
- Searching in the app just got easier. We've combined the search field and address bar so you don't have to think twice about which to use.
