We’ve removed the waitlist for DuckDuckGo Email Protection, making the beta open for everyone to try!
Email Protection beta is a free email forwarding service that removes multiple types of hidden email trackers and lets you create a personal @duck.com address and unlimited unique private email addresses. Plus, there's no need to switch email inboxes.
Signing up is easy: open the app Menu > Settings > Email Protection to get started.
