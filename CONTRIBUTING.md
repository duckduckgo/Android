## Contribute Code

We welcome pull requests aimed at fixing bugs and security issues. We have also labeled tasks you can help with as [help wanted](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

If you have a great idea you really want to implement, start by logging an issue for us and mention that you are interested in helping. If it fits with our product direction and is a good candidate for community development we may be able to bend the rules and work with you to develop it.
