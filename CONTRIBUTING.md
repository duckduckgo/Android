# Contributing to DuckDuckGo

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to DuckDuckGo! :sparkles

We are pleased to open up the project to you - our community. How can you contribute?

## Share feedback and bug reports
See [README.md](README.md)

## Contribute Code

We have labeled tasks you can help with as [help wanted](https://github.com/duckduckgo/Android/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).
As we are still opening up our repo, we cannot yet accept PRs outside this list. If you have a great idea
you really want to implement, start by logging an issue for us and mention that you are interested in helping.
 If it fits with our product direction and is a good candidate for community development we may be able to bend
 the rules and work with you to develop it.

## Style Guide

We care about clean code. Refer to our [style guide](styleguide/STYLEGUIDE.md).
