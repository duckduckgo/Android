### Style Guide

We care about clean code. Refer to our [style guide](styleguide/STYLEGUIDE.md).

### Commit Messages

See Chris Beams' guide to writing good commit messages https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

### Why is a build failing?

Bitrise as a our CI environment, [all builds can be seen here](https://app.bitrise.io/app/dc22e377b9a9ccbf#/builds).
We use [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) as a code formatter, and every build in Bitrise will trigger a check for several rules.
If your PR is failing because of that, please make sure that you have our [style guide](styleguide/STYLEGUIDE.md) imported and the code formatted.
You can also trigger an automatic code formatting of the code by executing:

```
./gradleW app:spotlessApply
```
