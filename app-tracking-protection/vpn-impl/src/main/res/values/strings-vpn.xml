    <string name="atp_ProfilingInfoTitle">What are app trackers?</string>
    <string name="atp_ProfilingInfoFirstParagraph" formatted="false">You\’ve probably heard about companies like Google and Facebook tracking you behind the scenes on third-party websites. But did you know they also track your personal information through apps on your device?\n\n<b>Over 96\% of the 100 popular free Android apps</b> we tested contained hidden third-party trackers. Of those, 87\% sent data to Google and 68\% sent data to Facebook. This happens even when you\’re not using your device.\n\n<b>Trackers in apps may have access to a lot more information</b> than their website tracker cousins, such as your location down to which floor of a building you\'re on, how often you play games while at work, and when and how long you sleep each day. <b>Even if you don\'t have a Google or Facebook account, for example, they can still collect data about you from your apps.</b>\n\nTracking networks like Facebook and Google use these little pieces of information <b>to build a digital profile about you.</b> With it, tracking networks can manipulate what you see online and allow advertisers to bid on access to you based on your data.\n\nTrackers in apps is a BIG problem for privacy. <b>But DuckDuckGo has a solution that can help.</b>\n\nWhen enabled in the DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser app, App Tracking Protection blocks many trackers in other apps on your device, at the same time that the DuckDuckGo app blocks trackers we find on websites when you browse. <b>These dual layers of protection reduce what tracking companies know about you overall</b>, so you can use your apps with more peace of mind, knowing you\’re more protected.</string>

    <!--  App Tracking Protection FAQ -->
    <string name="atp_FAQActivityTitle">FAQ</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQFirstHeader">How does App Tracking Protection work?</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQFirstText"><b>App Tracking Protection blocks known app trackers from other companies, like when Facebook tries to track you in a health app.</b> Companies may still track you in apps they own.</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQSecondHeader">Does App Tracking Protection block trackers in all my apps?</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQSecondText"><b>Protection may be automatically disabled for certain apps, like those that load websites, so that content appears normally</b>. For apps with known issues, this is mostly temporary as we work to improve App Tracking Protection. You can manage this protection for each app on your device in the settings.\n\nIn addition, some trackers may not be blocked because we haven\'t yet detected and added them to our blocklist. We are continually working to identify and protect against new trackers, so you can rest easy knowing you\'re getting the most up-to-date protection.\n\nYou can expect updates to our tracker list every few months. These updates will get applied on your device automatically</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQThirdHeader">Why does App Tracking Protection use a VPN connection?</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQThirdText">You’ll be asked to set up a virtual private network (VPN) connection, <b>but you don\'t need to install a VPN app for App Tracking Protection to work.</b>\n\nThis permission allows App Tracking Protection, which works locally on your device, to monitor network traffic <b>so that it can block known trackers.</b></string>
    <string name="atp_FAQFourthHeader">Will App Tracking Protection work if I also use a VPN app?</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQFourthText"><b>Android only allows one active VPN connection at a time.</b> That means you can\’t use App Tracking Protection while a VPN app on your device is running or set to “Always on.”\n\n<b>We recommend that you enable App Tracking Protection when you are not using a VPN app</b><![CDATA[ Just make sure your VPN app isn’t set to "always-on". Go to Android Network settings > VPN. Then, check the gear icon for any listed VPN apps and disable"always-on." Some VPN apps may also have an auto-connect setting which must be disabled.]]></string>
    <string name="atp_FAQFifthHeader">How is App Tracking Protection different from a VPN?</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQFifthText">A VPN sends your data from the device to its own server, where it secures and anonymizes your data from prying eyes. However, this allows the VPN company to see your network traffic.\n\n<b>App Tracking Protection is different.</b> Instead of sending your data to a VPN server, <b>App Tracking Protection works locally on your device</b>, sitting between your apps and the servers they talk to.\n\nWhenever App Tracking Protection recognizes a known tracker, <b>it blocks the tracker from sending personal information (such as your IP address, activity, and device details) off your device.</b> All other traffic reaches its destination, so your apps work normally.</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQSixthHeader">Is my data private?</string>
    <string name="atp_FAQSixthText">App Tracking Protection works on your device and doesn’t send your personal data off your device to DuckDuckGo.</string>
